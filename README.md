# Advanced Spell Effects

## This module requires the following modules to fully function
- JB2A (Patreon Version)
- Sequencer
- Warpgate
- Item Macro
- MIDI-QOL
- Advanced Macros
- SocketLib
- Tagger

## Usage Instructions
Eligible spells will display an "ASE" tab at the top of the item - this can be used to convert a spell to an ASE spell like shown in the example video below.
- Make sure the name of the spell is exactly correct or the "ASE" tab will not be visible.
- CONVERTING THE SPELL WILL CHANGE CERTAIN DATA ON THE ITEM ITSELF INCLUDING IT'S ITEM MACRO - ONLY CONVERT A SPELL THAT YOU DO NOT CARE ABOUT BEING OVERWRITTEN
